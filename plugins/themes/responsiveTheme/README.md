#ON HOLD UNTIL OJS 3

Unforunately, much of what would need to be changed to properly support Boostrap is hardcoded in OJS 2. The plan is to continue development of this theme after OJS 3 is released. 

This theme does not work with the latest versions of OJS 2. 

-----

BETA RELEASE, please report bugs to the issue tracker on github. 
Still MANY css issues to be dealt with. 

This project is a baseline for creating custom themes for OJS instances. 

Bootstrap (2.3.0) is applied to the 'out of the box' OJS html templates, which are stored in the 'templates'
directory. 

A special shoutout and thank you to John Willinsky of the PKP project!
